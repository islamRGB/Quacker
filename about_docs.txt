===========================
 ATXLP Overlay Suite v0.1.27
===========================

About:
------
ATXLP (Advanced Toolkit for eXperimental Layer Processing)
is an overlay suite that displays system-level spoofing,
EAC (Easy Anti-Cheat) replacement, and Fortnite build alignment.

The software displays randomized logs, memory inspections,
and API calls to mimic the look and feel of a professional
reverse-engineering or cheat development tool.

Fortnite Spoofing :
-----------------------------
- Build Sync:       Displays random Fortnite client build numbers
- HWID Masking:     Masks motherboard and drive serials
- GPU Driver Swap:  Hooks DirectX & Nvidia/AMD APIs
- EAC Redirect:     Logs suggest Easy Anti-Cheat is being replaced
- Error Handling:   Always ends with an "Outdated build" error
