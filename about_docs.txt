===========================
 ATXLP Overlay Suite v0.1.27
===========================

About:
------
ATXLP (Advanced Toolkit for eXperimental Layer Processing)
is a  overlay suite that simulates system-level spoofing,
EAC (Easy Anti-Cheat) replacement, and Fortnite build alignment.


The software displays randomized logs, fake memory inspections,
and spoofed API calls to mimic the look and feel of a professional
reverse-engineering or cheat development tool.

Fortnite Spoofing :
-----------------------------
- Fake Build Sync:   Displays random Fortnite client build numbers
- HWID Masking:      Simulates spoofing motherboard and drive serials
- GPU Driver Swap:   Pretends to hook DirectX & Nvidia/AMD APIs
- EAC Redirect:      Logs suggest Easy Anti-Cheat is being replaced
- Error Handling:    Always ends with a fake "Outdated build" error
